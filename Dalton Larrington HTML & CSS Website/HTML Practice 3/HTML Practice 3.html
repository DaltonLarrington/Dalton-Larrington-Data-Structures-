	<h2>My Experience with Lamoni</h2>
	<p>
	   I grew up in small towns all my life, never really knowing what a large community is like. 
	   Lamoni is like any other cow town. It has its cattle lots, and the traffic jams consist tractors and Amish buggies.
	   Lamoni is slightly different from other small towns in Iowa. Lamoni has Graceland, which has made Lamoni what it is today.
	   If Graceland where not in Lamoni, there would be less of a connection between professors and students. That is perhaps one of
	   the greatest attributes of Lamoni, connections.

<h3>Landmarks:</h3>	
	
<div>	
	<h3>Liden Street Coffee House</h3>	
	<p>
		The Liden Street Coffee House is the hip meeting place for all Lamoni residents.
		Enjoy a hot cup of java while relaxing in a sooting environment.
		Some nights you can find poetry slams here, and become a poet without knowing it.

<div>
	<h3>The Coliseum</h3>
	<p>
		The Lamoni Coliseum is early 20th century theater with balcony seating.
		The theater plays movies every weekend from Friday to Sunday. 
		The Coliseum is a great get away for both students of Graceland, and the residence of Lamoni.

	<h3>Graceland University</h3>
	<p>Graceland University is the pinnacle of Lamoni. It's grand campus upon the hill
	   is an eye catcher for visitors coming from afar. Graceland University is the cement
	   to Lamoni's foundation</p>
